# Vim AppImage Repository

This is a project for building a 64bit Gvim AppImage from the latest Vim snapshots.
AppImage is a form of cross-distribution packaging format that can be run
everywhere by simply downloading the image and starting it. For more
information about the package format see here: [AppImage](https://appimage.org).

The image is based on Ubuntu ~~20.04 LTS focal~~ 22.04 LTS jammy (since commit
[1bfa21b][1bfa21b] because Github retired the Ubuntu
20.04 images in April 2025)

The Appimage most likely won't work on older distributions. If you require a
Vim appimage, that runs on older distributions, you can download the last
Ubuntu 18.04 bionic based installation [v9.0.1413][v9.0.1413] and the last
Ubuntu 20.04 focal based installation [v9.1.1301][v9.1.1301]

[Download][Download] and execute the most recent `GVim-*.AppImage` file to run GVim.

If you want a terminal Vim, just create a symbolic link with a name starting with "vim". Like:
```
ln -s GVim-*.AppImage vim.appimage
```

Then start `vim.appimage` to get a terminal Vim.

The vim / gvim AppImage's are built with Vim interfaces for Perl, Python3, Ruby
and Lua. See the release notes for usage and details.
